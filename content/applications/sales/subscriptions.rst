.. _subscriptions/quotations:

Subscription quotations
=======================

.. important::
   Sales orders with a defined recurrence become subscriptions.

To create a new subscription, click on :guilabel:`New` from the **Subscriptions** or the :doc:`Sales
</applications/sales>` app. Then, from the resulting quotation, either:

- Select a :doc:`subscription plan </applications/sales/subscriptions/plans>` to auto-populate the
  quotation instantly.
- Or, fill out the quotation normally, making sure to select a recurrence, an end date (if
  necessary), and add :doc:`recurrent products </applications/sales/subscriptions/products>`.

.. tip::
   Define different invoice and delivery addresses by enabling the :doc:`Customer Addresses
   </applications/finance/accounting/customer_invoices/customer_addresses>` feature.

.. _subscriptions/confirmation:

Confirmation
============

Send the quotation to the customer for confirmation by clicking :guilabel:`Send by Email`, or
confirm it immediately by clicking :guilabel:`Confirm`.

.. tip::
   Click :guilabel:`Customer Preview` to preview the customer's point-of-view their quotation. From
   there, customers can sign and pay it, and communicate with the company, if needed.

.. _subscriptions/automatic-payments:

Automatic payments
==================

Require the customer to set an automatic payment method, and pre-pay the subscription's first
occurrence before they can confirm their quotation. To do so, go to the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab
of the quotation form, and tick the :guilabel:`Online payment` checkbox. The, designate what
percentage of the total should be paid.

If you leave :guilabel:`Online payment` unchecked, the customer does not have to pre-pay to start
the subscription. This means the payment is *not* automatic, and the customer **must** pay each
invoice manually.

.. important::
   If the online confirmation requires a pre-payment, the customer can **only** select the
   :ref:`payment providers <payment_providers/supported_providers>` that have the :ref:`tokenization
   feature <payment_providers/tokenization>`. This ensures the customer is automatically charged at
   each new period.
